The dataset is split into two folders, namely train and test. However, for training purposes, it should be split into three sets necessary for Machine Learning and Deep Learning tasks, namely train, validation, and test splits. The structure of the data is as follows:\n\n- ROOT\n   - train_images:\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - ........\n            - img_file.\n\n   - train_masks:\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - ........\n            - img_file.\n\n- valid_images:\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - ........\n            - img_file.\n\n   - valid_masks:\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - img_file;\n            - ........\n            - img_file.\n\nFor the object detection task, the bounding box coordinates can be obtained using masks provided in the train/valid masks directories. Good luck!"}
